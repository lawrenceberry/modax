# The thread-local kernel keeps them in the thread's own ``cuda.local`` arrays,
# which the compiler promotes to registers where the indexing is resolvable and
# otherwise places in local memory: off-chip DRAM, cached in L2, its latency
# hidden by occupancy once the device is saturated. Nothing on chip bounds its
# block size, but a block is a warp anyway, as in Rodas5P: a small ensemble
# then spreads over as many SMs as it has warps instead of sitting on one, and
# a large one is indifferent (Lorenz at 1000 trajectories, measured: 3.2 ms in
# 32-thread blocks against 6.9 ms in 128-thread blocks; 83 ms either way at
# 100000).
#
# The shared-memory kernel keeps the same nine vectors in per-block shared
# memory, laid out ``(n_vars, _SHARED_BLOCK)`` so that consecutive lanes hold
# consecutive words and a warp's access is bank-conflict-free. It costs
# ``9 * n_vars * _SHARED_BLOCK * 8`` bytes of static shared memory per block,
# which caps ``n_vars``, and by capping the blocks an SM can hold it loses to
# the thread-local kernel once the ensemble saturates the device: up to 14%
# at 100000 trajectories of 8 to 16 components. Below that the two are within
# noise of each other on an RTX 4070 SUPER -- at these sizes the local arrays
# are promoted to registers, and the on-chip copy buys nothing over them --
# so ``"auto"`` takes shared wherever the system fits and the ensemble is
# small enough, where it is never slower, and local beyond. ``backend``

    ``backend`` chooses where the kernel keeps the state and its stage vectors:
    ``"shared"`` in per-block shared memory, ``"local"`` in the thread's own
    local memory. The two are bit-identical; shared is faster where the device
    is under-occupied (small ensembles, low dimension) and local where it is
    saturated, and ``"auto"`` picks by the ensemble's size and the system's,
    taking shared whenever the system fits and the ensemble is small enough.

    The solve is an XLA custom call into the numba-cuda kernel, so it carries a
    ``jax.custom_jvp`` rule rather than being differentiated by XLA: asking for
    a derivative integrates the continuous forward-sensitivity system alongside
    the state (see ``modax/_sensitivity.py``). ``jax.jvp``, ``jax.jacfwd``,
    ``jax.grad``, ``jax.jacrev`` and ``jax.value_and_grad`` all work with
    respect to ``y0`` and ``params``; ``t_span`` is not differentiable. An
    undifferentiated call runs the plain kernel and pays nothing.

    ``sens_error_control`` decides whether the sensitivity components take part
    in the step-size error norm. The default ``True`` controls them to the same
    ``rtol``/``atol`` as the state, so the gradient is as accurate as the value.
    ``False`` drops them from the norm, which makes the joint solve take exactly
    the step sequence the plain solve takes -- the value then matches a plain
    call bit for bit -- at the cost of nothing tying the sensitivities' accuracy
    to ``rtol``.
