"""Lorenz chaotic system (3D) for solver benchmarks and tests.

Summary:
    dx/dt = σ(y − x)
    dy/dt = x(ρ − z) − y
    dz/dt = xy − βz

with σ = 10, β = 8/3 fixed and ρ as the ensemble parameter (centred at 28,
the standard chaotic regime; chaos onset at ρ ≈ 24.74).

The Lorenz attractor is a strange attractor: trajectories orbit it forever but
never repeat.  The maximum Lyapunov exponent λ ≈ 0.9 means that two initially
close trajectories diverge on a timescale of ~1/λ ≈ 1 time unit, so there is
no meaningful point-wise reference solution after t ≈ 5.

Instead the tests verify attractor confinement: a solver that accumulates too
much integration error leaves the attractor manifold and diverges to infinity,
while a correct solver keeps all trajectories within the known attractor
extent (|x|, |y| < 40, 0 ≤ z < 65 for ρ ≈ 28) even after long integration.
These bounds are the signature of a solver that stays on the manifold.

    bifurcation at rho=1. In this regime the origin is the unique globally stable
    fixed point, so every trajectory decays exponentially toward (0, 0, 0) with
    slowest eigenvalue lambda ~ -0.47.

    Step count is therefore strictly monotone in distance from the origin: a
    trajectory that starts far away must cross a large region of phase space with
    significant ODE velocities before the state becomes small enough for Tsit5 to
    take large steps.

    The hard base IC, _HARD_Y0 = [1000, -500, 500], is fixed analytically as a
    point far from the origin. The identical scenario places every trajectory
    there, so all share the same (maximum) step count and the batch shows zero
    divergence. The ic_large scenario scales each trajectory as _HARD_Y0 * (1-t)
    for t ~ U(0, divergence), moving it radially toward and then, for
    divergence > 1, past the origin. Because distance from the origin is the
    main driver of difficulty, values up to 1 span from near-maximum
    (t -> 0) down to near-zero (t -> 1), while larger divergence values add
    trajectories that start far away on the opposite radial branch.
